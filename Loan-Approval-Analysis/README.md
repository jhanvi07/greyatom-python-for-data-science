### Project Overview

 Dream Housing Finance Inc. specializes in home loans across different market segments - rural, urban and semi-urban. Thier loan eligibility process is based on customer details provided while filling an online application form. To create a targeted marketing campaign for different segments, they have asked for a comprehensive analysis of the data collected so far.,


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I have learned creating a dataframe by taking the data from a csv file. Also, cleaned the data by checking if any missing values are present and filled it. Used pivot table operations to check the loan amount of an average person based on gender, marriage status and employment status. For the government audit, I needed to find out the applicants with long loan term amount so I used apply function to do that. To check the average income of an applicant and the average loan given to a person based on their income, I used groupby function to include only income and credit history and found the mean using aggregation function.


### Challenges faced

 I wasn't able to figure out how to use the count() function.
