### Project Overview

 You have been hired by 'CACT'(Census Analysis and Collection Team) to help with your numpy programming skills. Your major work for today involves census record management and data analysis.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, you have a better grip on working with numpy. In this project, you will apply the following concepts:
1)Array Appending
2)Array Slicing
3)Array Filtering
4)Array Aggregation


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I used different functions like len,mean,min,and max and applied array indexing, array slicing to solve the problem.


### Challenges faced

 I didn't know how to find the minimum index but later found out that I have to use list and then find the index with minimum value.
