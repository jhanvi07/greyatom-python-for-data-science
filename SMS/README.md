### Project Overview

 This is a student management system which stores the student information such as their names, grades in a particular course, and finding the student with maximum marks.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I learned the use of lists, strings, dictionaries, and various functions such as split() and upper().


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I created 2 lists which stored all the student names. I concatenated those 2 lists to form a new list and performed append() and remove() functions on it. Then, I created a dictionary which stored all the courses and marks for a particular student. I calculated the total and find out the overall percentage of that student based on the total out of 500. Then I created another dictionary which stored only the mathematics marks of all the students and from that I used max() function to find out the student with maximum marks. After these steps, I printed out the topper student name and used split() and upper() function to print out that student name in a specific format to be displayed on a certificate.


### Challenges faced

 I had a challenge in the last step which was to figure out splitting the topper student name into firstname and lastname. It was because originally it was in a string format and I had to split and store it into a list. I kept getting concatenation error but I figured out the solution soon.
